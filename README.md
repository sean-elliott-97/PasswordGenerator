# PasswordGenerator

This project generates a random password that meets certain criteria.

Upon clicking the Generate Password button, users will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

When prompted for password criteria, users will select which criteria to include in the randomly generated password.

When prompted for the length of the password, users will select a length between 8 and 128 (numeric) characters.

When asked for which character types to include in the password, users decide whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

Answers to prompts will be validated and at least one character type will be selected.

When all prompts are answered, a random password is generated.

When the random password is generated, it is written to the page.
